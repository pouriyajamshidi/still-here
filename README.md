# Still Here

This extension gets rid of the annoying YouTube 'Video paused. Continue watching?' dialog box.

## Usage

It is available for the major browsers:

- Google Chrome (under review)
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-still-here/)
- [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/youtube-still-here/pkfgkcldniiineoelnemkcieglbcikbk)
- [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/youtube-still-here/)

Additionally you can clone this repository, head to your browser's extension settings, enable developer mode, click on `Load unpacked` and select the directory containing this repository.

## NOTE

At this stage, the functionality and structure of this extension is very basic and I plan to continue working on it the more I learn about JavaScript, HTML and CSS in my free time.
