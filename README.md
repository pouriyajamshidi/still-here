# Still Here

This extension gets rid of the annoying YouTube 'Video paused. Continue watching?' dialog box.

## NOTE

At this stage, the functionality and structure of this extension is very basic and I plan to continue working on it the more I learn about JavaScript, HTML and CSS in my free time.

## Usage

Clone this repository, head to your browser's extension settings, enable developer mode, click on `Load unpacked` and select the directory containing this repository.

## Tested on
